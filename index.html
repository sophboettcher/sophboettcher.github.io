<h1> Soph's Memory Box </h1>
<p>Welcome to my memory box! Here are some things from the month of January 2024 that feel special to me and capture my life at this moment in time<3</p>
<img src="IMG_5259.jpeg" alt="Sunset on the beach in Malibu">
<p> My current happy memory: a recent (almost) camping trip my friends and I took to watch the sunset on a beach in Malibu!</p>
<p> My current favorite song is heaven by the talking heads, specifically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGub7POe5UI"> the live version </a>

<p> ok that's all for now <3</p>
<h2> Note on tags and elements: </h2>
<p> I have added tags for the various headings, paragraphs, image, album link, and gif. I have also used css to alter the color, font, and spacial formatting of this webpage. I primarily based these edits off the instructions provided in our course slides but I also used ChatGPT for reference on how to add some of the more complex elements, such as the album link and adjusting certain elements on the page. I hope it is somewhat readable!</p>
